# [Forge Fetch API](https://thenoppy12.is-a.dev/ForgeFetchAPI/) / [Original](https://mrnavastar.github.io/ForgeVersionAPI/)
#### Version 1.3 - Created by MrNavaStar (updated by [BussyBakks](https://github.com/BussyBakks))

This api provides a simple way to get information about minecraft forge
installer versions. This information is provided via the [versions](https://thenoppy12.is-a.dev/ForgeFetchAPI/version.json) endpoint (version.json).

## Important Note!
If you wish to automate the forge install process, please consider supporting
the forge project on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/LexManos/) as they rely on ad revenue to fund the project. (i dont think he still alive to maintain this project... its 2 years ago...)
